In this assignment, we will be building on M2Pro1, remember M2Pro1 was the State Park analysis.
The program should continue to work the same only in this assignment. If you successfully completed M2Pro1, you will have a good head start. If not, you will first want to make sure that you complete M2Pro1 first.

What is different about this program? refer to instructions below:

1.  Fix Options 4 & 5.

* For these two points you were to analyze by Region. Only there was no Region field. You'll notice that I have an updated spreadsheet.
* The spreadsheet has a sheet titled "Region_by_park". So the first thing you'll do is add "Region" to the DataFrame, same way you add "State Code" to the DataFrame when working on M2Pro1.

2. Plot

* Plot results for options (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ). Each plot is to be displayed after the printed results
* Add titles for each plot. Also consider adding a title for x and y axis if needed.
* Each plot must have legend added(make sure it doesn't cover plotted data).
* Each plt is to be saved as a png (give each png a meaningful name, for instance "parks_by_state.png" if plotting option 3.
* Use seaborn library.
* Implement a function for each one of these options.
