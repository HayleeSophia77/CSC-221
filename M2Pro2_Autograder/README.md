Overview :

This assignment will require a good understanding of the skills learned in this module but it will also require researching some concepts that might have not been covered in depth. You will be provided with some links to help on these topics yet you might still need to research futher, why? Well because researching and learning new skills will always be a big part of your career and if some are thinking of chatGPT, then yes you can use it. Especially since I would like for you to try getting this assignment done on your own , you are allowed to use it.

I have a two links below, one for chatgpt and another to claude:

Remember, using generative AI can help save time but you will also have to fix and debug code it provides so we can't just depend on it. I also have a link below to a site that listed a few other generative AI that you could look at.

One last thing I'd like to point out. We will be building on this project, in one of the coming modules you will be placed in groups and will be required to preform some further enhancements on this project. So you will be learning from each other but for now, do your best and try to get as much as you can done.

So what is the project about? Well, you are to create a program that helps students test their understanding of different networking concepts.

Project overview:

The goal of this multi-module assignment is to create a Python auto-grader program capable of evaluating multiple student Python assignments of varying complexity. The project is designed to be completed in stages, progressively introducing more advanced testing techniques and features, culminating in a GUI-based application.

___

1. You will need to do is create a Flowchart for the program, this step is always done before starting to write the code and that's because flowcharts can help show clients how the program will work and get their approval on the process prior to writing the code.

A Video on created flowcharts is also linked below:

Use link below to open draw.io ( a site you can use to create the flowchart):

2. Create the program and make sure it delivers the expected results.

* Program is only Stop if the user choose menu option 3.

3. Remember, this is an auto-grader so make sure it's properly structured. You might want to consider modularizing it too.

4. Don't forget pseudocode.
