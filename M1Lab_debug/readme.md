Instructions:

1. For this assignment , you are to fix a program that isn't working. This is called debugging

2. The program worked before but an unexperienced programmer tried and enhance it and ended up ruining it!!!
Before attempting to fix it, you need to know what the program was meant to do. See the program description below:

Description: "The program should allow the user to run a driving test. So, the first thing is should do is display the menu."

3. If the user were to enter the number 1, the program would run the driving test. Notice the questions and answers are all referenced in a dictionary of dictionaries.

* Notice that the dictionary references 10 items, or questions. the question numbers are the keys and each key points to a dictionary that references a question.
* Also notice that each question ,represented in a dictionary, has two values, the first key "question" points to the actual question and the "answer" key points to the answer.
 
4. When the user chooses option 1, the program is to do the following:

* Display the question
* Ask the user to enter 1 for True or 2 for False
* Tell the user if their answer was correct or not .
* The program is to give the user 10 points for each correct answer . So if all 10 question were answered right, the user's score should be 100
* After all the questions are answered, tell the user what their score is
* If the user's score is greater than or equal to 80, tell them that they passed. And if not, tell them that they failed

5. Download the zipped folder below, it contains the two program files you need fix. When fixed, run the program and make sure that delivers results similar to what is shown.

6. Submit assignment using submission link (below this post). You should be submitting a zipped folder that contains the following (the 2 code files)
